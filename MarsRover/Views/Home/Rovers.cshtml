            <h3>Mission</h3>

            <p>
                Curiosity was launched on 26 November 2011 at 15:02:00 UTC and landed inside the Gale crater on Mars on 6 August 2012 at 05:17:57 UTC.
                Its mission was to investigate Martian climate and geology, and to see whether its landing site had ever offered conditions suitable for
                supporting microbial life in preparation for human exploration
            </p>

            <h3>Mission</h3>

            <p>
                Perseverance was launched on 30 July 2020, at 11:50 UTC, and was confirmed to have landed on 18 February 2021, at 20:55 UTC.
                It has a similar mission to Curiosity, including goals of identifying Martian environments capable of supporting life, and finding
                evidence of former microbial life existing on Mars.
            </p>



            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Looking for habitability: identify past environments that were capable of supporting microbial life</li>
                <li>
                    Seeking biosignatures: seed signs of possible past microbial life in those habitable enviroments, particularly in specific
                    rock types known to preserve signs over time
                </li>
                <li>Caching samples: collect core rock and regolith ("soil") samples and store them on the Martian surface</li>
                <li>Preparing for humans: test oxygen production from the Martian atmosphere</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mission</h3>

            <p>
                Opportunity was launched on 7 July 2003, at 03:18 UTC, and landed on 25 January 2004, at 05:05 UTC.
                It had a planned 90-sol duration of activity, but managed to stay operational for 5111 sols after landing by continually
                recharging its systems using solar power, exceeding the inital plan by 14 years, 46 days (in Earth time). Its last contact with
                NASA was on June 10, 2018, and it was declared dead on February 13, 2019 (rip in pepperonis)
            </p>



            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Search for and characterize a variety of rocks and regolith that hold clues to past water activity. 
                    In particular, samples sought include those that have minerals deposited by water-related processes such as 
                    precipitation, evaporation, sedimentary cementation or hydrothermal activity.</li>
                <li>Determine the distribution and composition of minerals, rocks, and regolith surrounding the landing sites</li>
                <li>Determine what geologic processes have shaped the local terrain and influenced the chemistry.
                    Such processes could include water or wind erosion, sedimentation, hydrothermal mechanisms, volcanism, and cratering.</li>
                <li>Perform calibration and validation of surface observations made by Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter instruments. 
                    This will help determine the accuracy and effectiveness of various instruments that survey Martian geology from orbit.</li>
                <li>Search for iron-containing minerals, identify and quantify relative amounts of specific mineral types that contain water 
                    or were formed in water, such as iron-bearing carbonates.</li>
                <li>Characterize the mineralogy and textures of rocks and regolith and determine the processes that created them.</li>
                <li>Search for geological clues to the environmental conditions that existed when liquid water was present.</li>
                <li>Assess whether those environments were conducive to life.</li>
            </ul>
