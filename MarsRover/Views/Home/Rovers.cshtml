            <h3>Mission</h3>

            <p>
                Curiosity was launched on 26 November 2011 at 15:02:00 UTC and landed inside the Gale crater on Mars on 6 August 2012 at 05:17:57 UTC.
                Its mission was to investigate Martian climate and geology, and to see whether its landing site had ever offered conditions suitable for
                supporting microbial life in preparation for human exploration
            </p>



            <h3>Objectives</h3>

            <h5>Biological</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Determine the nature and inventory of organic carbon compounds</li>
                <li>Investigate the chemical building blocks of life (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur)</li>
                <li>Identify features that may represent the effects of biological processes (biosignatures and biomolecules)</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Geological and geochemical</h5>
            <ol start="4">
                <li>Investigate the chemical, isotopic, and mineralogical composition of the Martian surface and near-surface geological materials</li>
                <li>Interpret the processes that have formed and modified rocks and soils</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Planetary process</h5>
            <ol start="6">
                <li>Assess long-timescale (i.e., 4-billion-year) Martian atmospheric evolution processes</li>
                <li>Determine present state, distribution, and cycling of water and carbon dioxide</li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Surface radiation</h5>
            <ol start="8">
                <li>Characterize the broad spectrum of surface radiation, including galactic and cosmic radiation, solar proton events and secondary neutrons.</li>
            </ol>




            <h3>Lifetime</h3>
            <p>
                Curiosity was initially launched with a two year mission in mind. In December 2012 its mission was extended indefinitely and as of today
                it is still operational.<br />
                Curiosity has been active on Mars for @Utilities.GetCuriositySols() sols since its landing.

            <h3>Mission</h3>

            <p>
                Perseverance was launched on 30 July 2020, at 11:50 UTC, and was confirmed to have landed on 18 February 2021, at 20:55 UTC.
                It has a similar mission to Curiosity, including goals of identifying Martian environments capable of supporting life, and finding
                evidence of former microbial life existing on Mars.
            </p>



            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Looking for habitability: identify past environments that were capable of supporting microbial life</li>
                <li>
                    Seeking biosignatures: seed signs of possible past microbial life in those habitable enviroments, particularly in specific
                    rock types known to preserve signs over time
                </li>
                <li>Caching samples: collect core rock and regolith ("soil") samples and store them on the Martian surface</li>
                <li>Preparing for humans: test oxygen production from the Martian atmosphere</li>
            </ul>
